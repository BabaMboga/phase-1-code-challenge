## Description
This project is inclusive of the following applications:
* Student Grade Generator
The application prompts the user for marks of a student and in return it returns the correct grade for the student
* Speed Detector
This program asks the user for the the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
* Net Salary Calculator
This programs major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by prompting the user for the inputs of basic salary and benefits.It then calculates the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary and returns all this information to the user.

NB: I used KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.
